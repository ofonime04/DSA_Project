### DATA SOURCE
The data source is an Amazon case study.xlsx which contains information from an Amazon product page. It contains product details (e.g name, category, price, discount, ratings) and Customer engagement (e.g user reviews, content). This Excel work sheet contains a total of 1,465 rows and 16 columns.

### TOOLS USED

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This involves the exploring of the data to answer some of the questions like
-	Products with discount of 50% and more
-	Products with highest number of reviews

#### Data Analysis
This is where we include some excel function to generate additional columns where required during the analysis. Example IF, COUNTIF and COUNT.

## RESULT AND RECOMMENDATION
